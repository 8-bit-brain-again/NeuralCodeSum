Get the metric Id which is used to generate metric names based on this dimension 
Installs the action dimension in case it is not installed yet The installation is already implemented based on the link column Name and link column Type If you want to perform additional actions beside adding the column to the database for instance adding an index you can overwrite this method We recommend to call this parent method to get the minimum required actions and then add further custom actions since this makes sure the column will be installed correctly We also recommend to change the default install behavior only if really needed FYI We do not directly execute those alter table statements here as we group them together with several other alter table statements do execute those changes in one step which results in a faster installation The column will be added to the log link visit action My SQL table 
Updates the action dimension in case the link column Type has changed The update is already implemented based on the link column Name and link column Type This method is intended not to overwritten by plugin developers as it is only supposed to make sure the column has the correct type Adding additional custom alter table actions would not really work since they would be executed with every link column Type change So adding an index here would be executed whenever the column Type changes resulting in an error if the index already exists If an index needs to be added after the first version is released a plugin update class should be created since this makes sure it is only executed once

Returns true if a new template is created as opposed to reusing the existing template 
Gets a formatting template which can be used to efficiently format a partial number where digits are added one by one 
Clears the internal state of the formatter so it can be reused 
Formats a phone number on the fly as each digit is entered 
Same as this input Digit but remembers the position where next Char is inserted so that is can be retrieved later by using this get Remembered Position The remembered position will be automatically adjusted if additional formatting characters are later inserted removed in front of next Char 
Some national prefixes are a substring of others If extracting the shorter NDD doesn t result in a number we can format we try to see if we can extract a longer version here 
Checks to see if there is an exact pattern match for these digits If so we should use this instead of any other formatting template whose leading Digits Pattern also matches the input 
returns the current position in the partially formatted phone number of the character which was previously passed in as a parameter of this input Digit And Remember Position

Invokes input Digit Helper on each digit of the national number accrued and returns a formatted string in the end 
Returns true if the current country is a NANPA country and the national number beings with the national prefix 
Returns the national prefix extracted or an empty string if it is not present 
Extracts IDD and plus sign to this prefix Before National Number when they are available and places the remaining input into this national Number 
Extracts the country calling code from the beginning of this national Number to this prefix Before National Number when they are available and places the remaining input into this national Number 
Accrues digits and the plus sign to this accrued Input Without Formatting for later use If next Char contains a digit in non ASCII format e g the full width version of digits it is first normalized to the ASCII version The return value is next Char itself or its normalized version if next Char is a digit in non ASCII format This method assumes its input is either a digit or the plus sign 
Gets a link Phone Number Util instance to carry out international phone number formatting parsing or validation The instance is loaded with phone number metadata for a number of most commonly used regions 
Helper initialiser method to create the regular expression pattern to match extensions allowing the one char extension symbols provided by 
Normalizes a string of characters representing a phone number by replacing all characters found in the accompanying map with the values therein and stripping all other characters if remove Non Matches is true 
Helper function to check if the national prefix formatting rule has the first group only i e does not start with the national prefix 
Returns the types we have metadata for based on the Phone Metadata object passed in 
Returns the types for a given region which the library has metadata for Will not include FIXED LINE OR MOBILE if the numbers in this region could be classified as FIXED LINE OR MOBILE both FIXED LINE and MOBILE would be present and UNKNOWN 
Returns the types for a country code belonging to a non geographical entity which the library has metadata for Will not include FIXED LINE OR MOBILE if numbers for this non geographical entity could be classified as FIXED LINE OR MOBILE both FIXED LINE and MOBILE would be present and UNKNOWN 
Gets the length of the geographical area code from the code national Number field of the Phone Number object passed in so that clients could use it to split a national significant number into geographical area code and subscriber number It works in such a way that the resultant subscriber number should be diallable at least on some devices An example of how this could be used 
Returns the metadata for the given region code or 
Returns the region where a phone number is from This could be used for geocoding at the region level Only guarantees correct results for valid full numbers not short codes or invalid numbers 
Gets the national significant number of the a phone number Note a national significant number doesn t contain a national prefix or any formatting 
is Number Geographical Phone Number 
Gets the type of a valid phone number 
Gets the length of the national destination code NDC from the Phone Number object passed in so that clients could use it to split a national significant number into NDC and subscriber number The NDC of a phone number is normally the first group of digit s right after the country calling code when the number is formatted in the international format if there is a subscriber number part that follows 
Formats a phone number in the specified format using default rules Note that this does not promise to produce a phone number that the user can dial from where they are although we do format in either national or international format depending on what the client asks for we do not currently support a more abbreviated format such as for users in the same area who could potentially dial the number without area code Note that if the phone number has a country calling code of or an otherwise invalid country calling code we cannot work out which formatting rules to apply so we return the national significant number with no formatting applied 
A helper function that is used by format and format By Pattern 
Returns the region code that matches the specific country calling code In the case of no region code being found ZZ will be returned In the case of multiple regions the one designated in the metadata as the main region for this calling code will be returned If the country Calling Code entered is valid but doesn t match a specific region such as in the case of non geographical calling codes like the value will be returned corresponding to the value for World in the UN M schema 
Note in some regions the national number can be written in two completely different ways depending on whether it forms part of the NATIONAL format or INTERNATIONAL format The number Format parameter here is used to specify which format to use for those cases If a carrier Code is specified this will be inserted into the formatted string to replace CC 
Note that carrier Code is optional if null or an empty string no carrier code replacement will take place 
Appends the formatted extension of a phone number to formatted Number if the phone number had an extension specified 
Returns the mobile token for the provided country calling code if it has one otherwise returns an empty string A mobile token is a number inserted before the area code when dialing a mobile number from that country from abroad 
Checks if the number is a valid vanity alpha number such as MICROSOFT A valid vanity number will start with at least digits and will have three or more alpha characters This does not do region specific checks to work out if this number is actually valid for a region it should be parsed and methods such as link is Possible Number With Reason and link is Valid Number should be used 
Checks to see if the string of characters could possibly be a phone number at all At the moment checks to see that the string begins with at least digits ignoring any punctuation commonly found in phone numbers This method does not require the number to be normalized in advance but does assume that leading non number symbols have been removed such as by the method extract Possible Number 
Strips any extension as in the part of the number dialled after the call is connected usually indicated with extn ext x or similar from the end of the number and returns it 
Parses a string and returns it in proto buffer format This method differs from link parse in that it always populates the raw input field of the protocol buffer with number To Parse as well as the country code source field 
Returns an iterable over all Phone Number Matches in text 
A helper function to set the values related to leading zeros in a Phone Number 
Parses a string and fills up the phone Number This method is the same as the public parse method with the exception that it allows the default region to be null for use by is Number Match check Region should be set to false if it is permitted for the default region to be null or unknown ZZ 
Returns a new phone number containing only the fields needed to uniquely identify a phone number rather than any fields that capture the context in which the phone number was created These fields correspond to those set in parse rather than parse And Keep Raw Input 
Converts number To Parse to a form that we can parse and write it to national Number if it is written in RFC otherwise extract a possible number out of it and write to national Number 
Attempts to extract a possible number from the string passed in This currently strips all leading characters that cannot be used to start a phone number Characters that can be used to start a phone number are defined in the VALID START CHAR PATTERN If none of these characters are found in the number passed in an empty string is returned This function also attempts to strip off any alternative extensions or endings if two or more are present such as in the case of x x The second extension here makes this actually two phone numbers x and x We remove the second extension so that the first number is parsed correctly 
Checks to see that the region code used is valid or if it is not valid that the number to parse starts with a symbol so that we can attempt to infer the region from the number Returns false if it cannot use the region provided and the region cannot be inferred 
Tries to extract a country calling code from a number This method will return zero if no country calling code is considered to be present Country calling codes are extracted in the following ways ul li by stripping the international dialing prefix of the region the person is dialing from if this is present in the number and looking at the next digits li by stripping the sign if present and then looking at the next digits li by comparing the start of the number and the country calling code of the default region If the number is not considered possible for the numbering plan of the default region initially but starts with the country calling code of this region validation will be reattempted after stripping this country calling code If this number is considered a possible number then the first digits will be considered the country calling code and removed as such ul It will throw a Number Parse Exception if the number starts with a but the country calling code supplied after this does not match that of any known region 
Strips any international prefix such as present in the number provided normalizes the resulting number and indicates if an international prefix was present 
Normalizes a string of characters representing a phone number This performs the following conversions Punctuation is stripped For ALPHA VANITY numbers Letters are converted to their numeric representation on a telephone keypad The keypad used here is the one defined in ITU Recommendation E This is only done if there are or more letters in the number to lessen the risk that such letters are typos For other numbers Wide ascii digits are converted to normal ASCII European digits Arabic Indic numerals are converted to European numerals Spurious alpha characters are stripped 
Strips the IDD from the start of the number if present Helper function used by maybe Strip International Prefix And Normalize 
Extracts country calling code from full Number returns it and places the remaining number in national Number It assumes that the leading plus sign or IDD has already been removed Returns if full Number doesn t start with a valid country calling code and leaves national Number unmodified 
Strips any national prefix such as present in the number provided 
Convenience wrapper around is Possible Number For Type With Reason Instead of returning the reason reason for failure this method returns true if the number is either a possible fully qualified number containing the area code and country code or if the number could be a possible local number with a country code but missing an area code Local numbers are considered possible if they could be possibly dialled in this format if the area code is needed for a call to connect the number is not considered possible without it 
Returns a list with the region codes that match the specific country calling code For non geographical country calling codes the region code is returned Also in the case of no region code being found an empty list is returned 
Returns the country calling code for a specific region For example this would be for the United States and for New Zealand Assumes the region is already valid 
Returns a number formatted in such a way that it can be dialed from a mobile phone in a specific region If the number cannot be reached from the region e g some countries block toll free numbers from being called outside of the country the method returns an empty string 
Formats a phone number in national format for dialing using the carrier as specified in the code carrier Code The code carrier Code will always be used regardless of whether the phone number already has a preferred domestic carrier code stored If code carrier Code contains an empty string returns the number in national format without any carrier code 
Formats a phone number in national format for dialing using the carrier as specified in the preferred Domestic Carrier Code field of the Phone Number object passed in If that is missing use the code fallback Carrier Code passed in instead If there is no code preferred Domestic Carrier Code and the code fallback Carrier Code contains an empty string return the number in national format without any carrier code 
Returns true if the number can be dialled from outside the region or unknown If the number can only be dialled from within the region returns false Does not check the number is a valid number Note that at the moment this method does not handle short numbers which are currently all presumed to not be diallable from outside their country 
Formats a phone number for out of country dialing purposes 
Formats a phone number for out of country dialing purposes If no region Calling From is supplied we format the number in its INTERNATIONAL format If the country calling code is the same as that of the region where the number is from then NATIONAL formatting will be applied 
Formats a phone number using the original phone number format that the number is parsed from The original format is embedded in the country code source field of the Phone Number object passed in If such information is missing the number will be formatted into the NATIONAL format by default When we don t have a formatting pattern for the number the method returns the raw inptu when it is available 
Returns the national dialling prefix for a specific region For example this would be for the United States and for New Zealand Set strip Non Digits to true to strip symbols like which indicates a wait for a dialling tone from the prefix returned If no national prefix is present we return null 
Check if raw Input which is assumed to be in the national format has a national prefix The national prefix is assumed to be in digits only form 
Tests whether a phone number matches a valid pattern Note this doesn t verify the number is actually in use which is impossible to tell by just looking at a number itself It only verifies whether the parsed canonicalised number is valid not whether a particular series of digits entered by the user is diallable from the region provided when parsing For example the number can be parsed into a number with country code and national significant number This is valid while the original string is not diallable 
Tests whether a phone number is valid for a certain region Note this doesn t verify the number is actually in use which is impossible to tell by just looking at a number itself If the country calling code is not the same as the country calling code for the region this immediately exits with false After this the specific number pattern rules for the region are examined This is useful for determining for example whether a particular number is valid for Canada rather than just a valid NANPA number Warning In most cases you want to use link is Valid Number instead For example this method will mark numbers from British Crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man as invalid for the region GB United Kingdom since it has its own region code IM which may be undesirable 
Parses a string and returns it as a phone number in proto buffer format The method is quite lenient and looks for a number in the input text raw input and does not check whether the string is definitely only a phone number To do this it ignores punctuation and white space as well as any text before the number e g a leading Tel and trims the non number bits It will accept a number in any format E national international etc assuming it can interpreted with the default Region supplied It also attempts to convert any alpha characters into digits if it thinks this is a vanity number of the type MICROSOFT 
Formats a phone number in the specified format using client defined formatting rules Note that if the phone number has a country calling code of zero or an otherwise invalid country calling code we cannot work out things like whether there should be a national prefix applied or how to format extensions so we return the national significant number with no formatting applied 
Gets an invalid number for the specified region This is useful for unit testing purposes where you want to test what will happen with an invalid number Note that the number that is returned will always be able to be parsed and will have the correct country code It may also be a valid short number code for this region Validity checking such numbers is handled with link Short Number Info 
Gets a valid number for the specified region and number type 
Gets a valid number for the specified country calling code for a non geographical entity 
Takes two phone numbers and compares them for equality 
Returns true when one national number is the suffix of the other or both are the same 
Returns true if the supplied region supports mobile number portability Returns false for invalid unknown or regions that don t support mobile number portability 
Check whether a phone number is a possible number given a number in the form of a string and the region where the number could be dialed from It provides a more lenient check than link is Valid Number See link is Possible Number Phone Number for details 
Check whether a phone number is a possible number of a particular type For types that don t exist in a particular region this will return a result that isn t so useful it is recommended that you use link get Supported Types For Region or link get Supported Types For Non Geo Entity respectively before calling this method to determine whether you should call it for this number at all 
Attempts to extract a valid number from a phone number that is too long to be valid and resets the Phone Number object passed in to that valid version If no valid number could be extracted the Phone Number object passed in will not be modified

Processes the custom build flags and gets a Metadata Filter which may be used to filter Phone Metadata objects Incompatible flag combinations throw Runtime Exception 
Returns the national prefix of the provided country element 
Extracts the available formats from the provided DOM element If it does not contain any national Prefix Formatting Rule the one passed in is retained similarly for national Prefix Optional When Formatting The national Prefix national Prefix Formatting Rule and national Prefix Optional When Formatting values are provided from the parent territory element 
Extracts the pattern for the national format 
Extracts the pattern for international format If there is no intl Format default to using the national format If the intl Format is set to NA the intl Format should be ignored 
Parses a possible length string into a set of the integers that are covered 
Reads the possible length present in the metadata and splits them into two sets one for full length numbers one for local numbers 
Sets possible lengths in the general description derived from certain child elements 
Sets the possible length fields in the metadata from the sets of data passed in Checks that the length is covered by the parent phone number description element if one is present and if the lengths are exactly the same as this they are not filled in for efficiency reasons 
Processes a phone number description element from the XML file and returns it as a Phone Number Desc If the description element is a fixed line or mobile number the parent description will be used to fill in the whole element if necessary or any components that are missing For all other types the parent description will only be used to fill in missing components if the type has a partial definition For example if no toll Free element exists we assume there are no toll free numbers for that locale and return a phone number description with no national number data and for this possible lengths Note that the parent description must therefore already be processed before this method is called on any child elements

The input blacklist or whitelist string is expected to be of the form a b c d e f where b and c are children of a e is a child of d and f is either a parent field a child field or a childless field Order and whitespace don t matter We throw Runtime Exception for any duplicates malformed strings or strings where field tokens do not correspond to strings in the sets of excludable fields We also throw Runtime Exception for empty strings since such strings should be treated as a special case by the flag checking code and not passed here 
Does not check that legal tokens are used assuming that field Map is constructed using parse Field Map From String which does check If field Map contains illegal tokens or parent fields with no children or other unexpected state the behavior of this function is undefined 
Clears certain fields in metadata as defined by the Metadata Filter instance Note that this changes the mutable metadata object If this method does not return successfully do not assume metadata has not changed

Gets the expected cost category of a short number when dialled from a region however nothing is implied about its validity If it is important that the number is valid then its validity must first be checked using link is Valid Short Number For Region Note that emergency numbers are always considered toll free Example usage pre code short Info Short Number Info get Instance short Number Phone Number Util parse US region Code FR if short Info is Valid Short Number For Region short Number region Code cost short Info get Expected Cost For Region short Number region Code Do something with the cost information here pre 
Gets the expected cost category of a short number however nothing is implied about its validity If the country calling code is unique to a region this method behaves exactly the same as link get Expected Cost For Region Phone Number String However if the country calling code is shared by multiple regions then it returns the highest cost in the sequence PREMIUM RATE UNKNOWN COST STANDARD RATE TOLL FREE The reason for the position of UNKNOWN COST in this order is that if a number is UNKNOWN COST in one region but STANDARD RATE or TOLL FREE in another its expected cost cannot be estimated as one of the latter since it might be a PREMIUM RATE number 
TODO Once we have benchmarked Shortnumber Info consider if it is worth keeping this performance optimization

find the locations of each of the words Nothing exciting here The array unique is required unless you decide to make the words unique before passing in 
Work out which is the most relevant portion to display This is done by looping over each match and finding the smallest distance between two found strings The idea being that the closer the terms are the better match the snippet would be When checking for matches we only change the location if there is a better match The only exception is where we have only two matches in which case we just take the first as will be equally distant 
 ratio on prevcount tends to work pretty well and puts the terms in the middle of the extract

Converts an OODBBean to Model 
Dispenses this bean 
Finds a bean using this model and a where clause SQL As with most Query tools in Red Bean you can provide values to be inserted in the SQL statement by populating the value array parameter you can either use the question mark notation or the slot notation keyname 
The find All method differs from the find method in that it does not assume a WHERE clause so this is valid 
Like find but also exports the beans as an array This method will perform a find operation For every bean in the result collection this method will call the export method This method returns an array containing the array representations of every bean in the result set 
Tries to find beans matching the specified type and criteria set 
Like Model find but returns the first bean only 
Finds a Bean Collection using the repository A bean collection can be used to retrieve one bean at a time using cursors this is useful for processing large datasets A bean collection will not load all beans into memory all at once just one at a time 
Loads a bean from the object database It searches for this bean Object in the database It does not matter how this bean has been stored Red Bean uses the primary key ID id and the string type to find the bean If Red Bean finds the bean it will return the Bean object if it cannot find the bean Red Bean will return a new bean with primary key ID In the latter case it acts basically the same as instance 
Match Up is a powerful productivity boosting method that can replace simple control scripts with a single Red Bean PHP command Typically match Up is used to replace login scripts token generation scripts and password reset scripts The Match Up method takes an SQL query snippet starting at the WHERE clause SQL bindings a pair of task arrays and a bean reference 
Calculates a diff between this bean and another bean or arrays of beans The result of this method is an array describing the differences of the second bean compared to this bean where this bean is taken as reference The array is keyed by type property id and property name where type property is either the type in case of the root bean or the property of the parent bean where the type resides The diffs are mainly intended for logging you cannot apply these diffs as patches to other beans However this functionality might be added in the future 
Stores a bean in the database If the database schema is not compatible with this bean and Red Bean runs in fluid mode the schema will be altered to store the bean correctly If the database schema is not compatible with this bean and Red Bean runs in frozen mode it will throw an exception This function returns the primary key ID of the inserted bean
