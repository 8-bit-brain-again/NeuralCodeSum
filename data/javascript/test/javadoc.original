All container nodes are kept on a linked list in declaration order This list is used by the get Local Name Of Container function in the type checker to validate that the local name used for a container is unique 
This is a useful function for debugging purposes 
Returns true if this node is missing from the actual source code A missing node is different from undefined defined When a node is undefined which can happen for optional nodes in the tree it is definitely missing However a node may be defined but still be missing This happens whenever the parser knows it needs to parse something but can t get anything in the source code that it expects at that location For example let a Here the Type in the Type Annotation is not optional as there is a colon in the source code So the parser will attempt to parse out a type and will create an actual node However this node will be missing in the sense that no actual source code tokens are contained within it

Gets the nearest enclosing block scope container that has the provided node as a descendant that is not the provided node 
Returns the node flags for this node and all relevant parent nodes This is done so that nodes like variable declarations and binding elements can returned a view of their flags that includes the modifiers from their container i e flags like export declare aren t stored on the variable declaration directly but on the containing variable statement if it has one Similarly flags for let const are store on the variable declaration list By calling this function all those flags are combined so that the client can treat the node as if it actually had those flags

Invokes a callback for each child of the given node The cb Node callback is invoked for all child nodes stored in properties If a cb Nodes callback is specified it is invoked for embedded arrays otherwise embedded arrays are flattened and the cb Node callback is invoked for each element If a callback returns a truthy value iteration stops and that value is returned Otherwise undefined is returned 
Produces a new Source File for the new Text provided The text Change Range parameter indicates what changed between the text that this Source File has and the new Text The Source File will be created with the compiler attempting to reuse as many nodes from this file as possible Note this function mutates nodes from this Source File That means any existing nodes from this Source File that are being held onto may change as a result including becoming detached from any Source File It is recommended that this Source File not be used once update is called on it

This function creates a synthetic symbol that combines the value side of one symbol with the type namespace side of another symbol Consider this example declare module graphics interface Point x number y number declare var graphics Point new x number y number graphics Point declare module graphics export graphics An import Point from graphics needs to create a symbol that combines the value side Point property with the type namespace side interface Point 
When an alias symbol is referenced we need to mark the entity it references as referenced and in turn repeat that until we reach a non alias or an exported entity which is always considered referenced We do this by checking the target of the alias as an expression which recursively takes us back here if the target references another alias 
This function is only for imports with entity names 
Resolves a qualified name and any involved aliases 
An external module with an export declaration may be referenced as an ES module provided the export references a symbol that is at least declared as a module or a variable The target of the export may combine other declarations with the module or variable e g a class module function module interface variable 
A reserved member name starts with two underscores but the third character cannot be an underscore or the 
Check if the symbol is used in export assignment 
Return the type of the given property in the given type or undefined if no such property exists 
Return the type of a binding element parent We check Symbol Links first to see if a type has been assigned by contextual typing 
Return the inferred type for a binding element 
Return the inferred type for a variable parameter or property declaration 
Return the type implied by a binding pattern element This is the type of the initializer of the element if one is present Otherwise if the element is itself a binding pattern it is the type implied by the binding pattern Otherwise it is the type any 
Return the type implied by an object binding pattern 
Return the type implied by a binding pattern This is the type implied purely by the binding pattern itself and without regard to its context i e without regard any type annotation or initializer associated with the declaration in which the binding pattern is contained For example the implied type of x y is any any and the implied type of x y z is x any y number The type implied by a binding pattern is used as the contextual type of an initializer associated with the binding pattern Also for a destructuring parameter with no type annotation or initializer the type implied by the binding pattern becomes the type of the parameter 
Return the type associated with a variable parameter or property declaration In the simple case this is the type specified in a type annotation or inferred from an initializer However in the case of a destructuring declaration it is a bit more involved For example var x s one Here the array literal one is contextually typed by the type any string which is the implied type of the binding pattern x s Because the contextual type is a tuple type the resulting type of one is the tuple type number string Thus the type inferred for x is number and the type inferred for s is string 
The local type parameters are the combined set of type parameters from all declarations of the class interface or type alias 
The base constructor of a class can resolve to undefined Type if the class has no extends clause unknown Type if an error occurred during resolution of the extends expression null Type if the extends expression is the null value or an object type with at least one construct signature 
A type reference is considered independent if each type argument is considered independent 
A variable like declaration is considered independent free of this references if it has a type annotation that specifies an independent type or if it has no type annotation and no initializer and thus of type any 
A function like declaration is considered independent free of this references if it has a return type annotation that is considered independent and if each parameter is considered independent 
The mapping This Only flag indicates that the only type parameter being mapped is this When the flag is true we check symbols to see if we can quickly conclude they are free of this references thus needing no instantiation 
The signatures of a union type are those signatures that are present in each of the constituent types Generic signatures must match exactly but non generic signatures are allowed to have extra optional parameters and may differ in return types When signatures differ in return types the resulting return type is the union of the constituent return types 
If the given type is an object type and that type has a property by the given name return the symbol for that property Otherwise return undefined 
For a type parameter return the base constraint of the type parameter For the string number boolean and symbol primitive types return the corresponding object types Otherwise return the type itself Note that the apparent type of a union type is the union type itself 
Return the symbol for the property with the given name in the given type Creates synthetic union properties when necessary maps primitive types and type parameters are to their apparent types and augments with properties from Object and Function as appropriate 
Return list of type parameters with duplicates removed duplicate identifier errors are generated in the actual type checking functions 
This function is used to propagate certain flags when creating new object type references and union types It is only necessary to do so if a constituent type might be the undefined type the null type the type of an object literal or the any Function Type This is because there are operations in the type checker that care about the presence of such types at arbitrary depth in a containing type 
Get type from reference to class or interface 
Get type from reference to type alias When a type alias is generic the declared type of the type alias may include references to the type parameters of the alias We replace those with the actual type arguments by instantiating the declared type Instantiations are cached using the type identities of the type arguments as the key 
Get type from reference to named type that cannot be generic enum or type parameter 
Returns a type that is inside a namespace at the global scope e g get Exported Type From Namespace JSX Element returns the JSX Element type 
Creates a Type Reference for a generic Typed Property Descriptor T 
Add the given types to the given type set Order is preserved duplicates are removed and nested types of the given kind are flattened into the set 
We reduce the constituent type set to only include types that aren t subtypes of other types unless the no Subtype Reduction flag is specified in which case we perform a simple deduplication based on object identity Subtype reduction is possible only when union types are known not to circularly reference themselves as is the case with union types created by expression constructs such as array literals and the and operators Named types can circularly reference themselves and therefore cannot be deduplicated during their declaration For example type Item string Item is a named type that circularly references itself 
We do not perform structural deduplication on intersection types Intersection types are created only by the type operator and we can t reduce those because we want to support recursive intersection types For example a type alias of the form type List T T next List T cannot be reduced during its declaration Also unlike union types the order of the constituent types is preserved in order that overload resolution for intersections of types with signatures can be deterministic 
Checks if source is related to target e g is a assignable to 
Compare two types and return Ternary True if they are related with no assumptions Ternary Maybe if they are related with assumptions of other relationships or Ternary False if they are not related 
Check if a property with the given name is known anywhere in the given type In an object type a property is considered known if the object type is empty and the check is for assignability if the object type has index signatures or if the property is actually declared in the object type In a union or intersection type a property is considered known if it is known in any constituent type 
Determine if two object types are related by structure First check if the result is already available in the global cache Second check if we have already started a comparison of the given two types in which case we assume the result to be true Third check if both types are part of deeply nested chains of generic type instantiations and if so assume the types are equal and infinitely expanding Fourth if we have reached a depth of nested comparisons assume we have runaway recursion and issue an error Otherwise actually compare the structure of the two types 
Return true if the given type is part of a deeply nested chain of generic instantiations We consider this to be the case when structural type comparisons have been started for or more instantiations of the same generic type It is possible though highly unlikely for this test to be true in a situation where a chain of instantiations is not infinitely expanding Effectively we will generate a false positive when two types are structurally equal to at least levels but unequal at some level beyond that 
For a union type remove all constituent types that are of the given type kind when is Of Type Kind is true or not of the given type kind when is Of Type Kind is false 
Check if a given variable is assigned within a given syntax node

Return contextual type of parameter or undefined if no contextual type is available 
In a variable parameter or property declaration with a type annotation the contextual type of an initializer expression is the type of the variable parameter or property Otherwise in a parameter declaration of a contextually typed function expression the contextual type of an initializer expression is the contextual type of the parameter Otherwise in a variable or parameter declaration with a binding pattern name the contextual type of an initializer expression is the type implied by the binding pattern 
Apply a mapping function to a contextual type and return the resulting type If the contextual type is a union type the mapping function is applied to each constituent type and a union of the resulting types is returned 
Return true if the given contextual type provides an index signature of the given kind 
In an object literal contextually typed by a type T the contextual type of a property assignment is the type of the matching property in T if one exists Otherwise it is the type of the numeric index signature in T if one exists Otherwise it is the type of the string index signature in T if one exists 
In an array literal contextually typed by a type T the contextual type of an element expression at index N is the type of the property with the numeric name N in T if one exists Otherwise if T has a numeric index signature it is the type of the numeric index signature in T Otherwise in ES and higher the contextual type is the iterated type of T 
In a contextually typed conditional expression the true false expressions are contextually typed by the same type 
If the given type is an object or union type if that type has a single signature and if that signature is non generic return the signature Otherwise return undefined 
Return the contextual signature for a given expression node A contextual type provides a contextual signature if it has a single call signature and if that call signature is non generic If the contextual type is a union type get the signature from each type possible and if they are all identical ignoring their return type the result is same signature but with return type as union type of return types from these signatures

If index Argument Expression is a string literal or number literal returns its text If index Argument Expression is a constant value returns its string value If index Argument Expression is a well known symbol returns the property name corresponding to this symbol as long as it is a proper symbol reference Otherwise returns undefined 
Re order candidate signatures into the result array Assumes the result array to be empty The candidate list orders groups in reverse but within a group signatures are kept in declaration order A nit here is that we reorder only signatures that belong to the same symbol so order how inherited signatures are processed is still preserved interface A x string void interface B extends A x foo string let b B b foo here overloads should be processed as x foo string x string void 
If type has a single call signature and no other members return that signature Otherwise return undefined

 Database Constructor 
 Converts a string to a UTF char array and wraps it in an adopted pointer which is GC managed and kept alive until it s referenced by a variable The reason for doing it is that i OS runtime marshals JS string arguments via temporary buffers which are deallocated immediately after the call returns In some cases however we need them to stay alive for subsequent native calls because otherwise attempts to read the freed memory may lead to unpredictable app crashes E g sqlite step function happens to use the stored char passed as dbname to sqlite open v

 Perform binary search to find search Element into a generic array It uses a customized compare Func to perform the comparison between two elements of the array and a get Element function to pick the element from the array e g in case we want to pick a field of an array of objects 
 Returns true if this slider has limit false otherwise There can be an upper limit and a lower limit for the sliders The lower upper limits are values that are out of the slider range but that can be selected by the user when he moves a slider all the way down the minimum and up to the maximum value 
 This method is called whenever the style of the grips needs to get updated 
 Set left and right handle at the right position on the screen pixels given the desired position in currency 
 Set the position of the handles at the specified pixel points taking the whole slider width as a maximum point 
 Updates the CSS of grips and bar so that the left grip appears at left Px and the right grip appears at right Px Note left Px can be right Px

just call set position on the current values 
 This one is the public method called externally It sets the position and notifies in fact 
 This tells the slider to increment its step non linearly over the current range based on the histogram on where results are 
 This method highlights the range of the slider apart from the position of the slider grips To work well the slider must have background color set to transparent in the CSS or not set 
 Sets the increment rounding for the slider see input parameters section for more information 
 This method rounds a given value to the closest integer defined according to the rounding Examples rounding v rounding v rounding v 
 Utility function Given a value within the range of the slider converts the value in pixels If a value to pixel mapping function is defined it will be used otherwise a linear mapping is used for the conversion

This class recognizes single byte encodings Because the encoding scheme is so simple language statistics are used to do the matching

A Table requires a definition to operate upon The table definition requires a url for requesting data and an array of cols column definitions An object in the cols array requires a header Label data Property and a percentage width The Table may also receive a sort Col Index which adds required fields to the cols objects of sort Direction ascending descending and data Type string number percent time or status The table definition may also include a pagination object with two required properties cursor the starting index and size number of lines per page 
Triggered when data is received correctly from the server 
Retrieves the data for the table also triggers pagination 
Triggers quick filtering and advanced filtering of the data if either of those properties have been set 
Filters out table data that does not match the filter value for table cols that have quick Filter set to true Also checks to see if there is a specified column to apply the filter to denoted by filter Value being separated by 
Filters out table data where any property value equals a matching property value on an advanced filter unless the advanced filter has been checked

Bulk add or remove keys to from the Table s selected items 
Add or remove a key to from the Table s selected items 
Creates an instance of Table 
Handles all events sent from the dispatcher Filters out to only those sent via the Table 
Requests data for a component when the filter property changes When comparing filters we do a direct comparison in addition to a JSON stringify comparison This fixes issues where the filters object is a new literal object every time but isn t actually changing Using a JSON stringify has the downside of causing request Data to be called if the objects are in a different order but that is pretty unlikely to happen The set Timeout insures that the currently dispatched action has completed the dispatching process before the request data action is kicked off 
Used to add and remove the listeners required when requesting data from the server 
Adds the listeners required when requesting data from the server

Adds an object to an array If the array already includes the object this method has no effect 
Replaces objects in an array with the passed objects 
Calculates the intersection of two arrays This method returns a new array filled with the records that the two passed arrays share with each other If there is no intersection an empty array will be returned 
Remove an event listener 
Suspend listener during callback 
called whenever a property has just changed to update dependent keys 
Sets the value of a property on an object respecting computed properties and notifying observers and other listeners of the change If the property is not defined but the object implements the set Unknown Property method then that will be invoked as well 
Adds a value to the map If a value for the given key has already been provided the new value will replace the old value 
Removes a value from the map for an associated key 
Iterate over all the keys and values Calls the function once for each key passing in the key and value in that order 
 COMPUTED PROPERTY A computed property transforms an objects function into a property 
TODO remove me only being used for Ember run sync 
 BINDING 
 CONNECT AND SYNC Attempts to connect this binding instance so that it can receive and relay changes This method will raise an exception if you have not set the from to properties yet 
Disconnects the binding instance Changes will no longer be relayed You will not usually need to call this method 
Creates a new Binding instance and makes it apply in a single direction A one way binding will relay changes on the from side object supplied as the from argument the to side but not the other way around This means that if you change the to side directly the from side may have a different value 
RSVP filter is similar to Java Script s native filter method except that it waits for all promises to become fulfilled before running the filter Fn on each item in given to promises RSVP filter returns a promise that will become fulfilled with the result of running filter Fn on the values the promises become fulfilled with

Retrieve the value given a key if the value is present at the current level use it otherwise walk up the parent hierarchy and try again If no matching key is found return undefined 
Check for the existence of given a key if the key is present at the current level return true otherwise walk up the parent hierarchy and try again If no matching key is found return false 
Iterate and invoke a callback for each local key value pair 
Apply formatting options to the string This will look for occurrences of in your string and substitute them with the arguments you pass into this method If you want to control the specific order of replacement you can add a number after the key as well to indicate which argument you want to insert 
Formats the passed string but first looks up the string in the localized strings hash This is a convenient way to localize text See Ember String fmt for more information on formatting 
Replaces underscores spaces or camel Case with dashes 
Set the value of a property to the current value plus some amount 
Set the value of a property to the current value minus some amount 
Creates a new subclass 
In some cases you may want to annotate computed properties with additional metadata about how they function or what values they operate on For example computed property functions may close over variables that are then no longer available for introspection 
Iterate over each computed property for the class passing its name and any associated metadata see meta For Property to the callback 
Returns an array with the items that do not have truthy values for key You can pass an optional second argument with the target value Otherwise this will match any property that evaluates to false 
Returns a new enumerable that excludes the passed value The default implementation returns an array regardless of the receiver type unless the receiver does not contain the value 
Returns a new enumerable that contains only unique values The default implementation returns an array regardless of the receiver type 
 ARRAY OBSERVERS Adds an array observer to the receiving array The array observer object normally must implement two methods 
If you are implementing an object that supports Ember Array call this method just before the array content changes to notify any observers and invalidate any related properties Pass the starting index of the change as well as a delta of the amounts to change 
If you are implementing an object that supports Ember Array call this method just after the array content changes to notify any observers and invalidate any related properties Pass the starting index of the change as well as a delta of the amounts to change

The collection of functions keyed by name available on this Action Handler as action targets 
Triggers a named action on the Action Handler Any parameters supplied after the action Name string will be passed as arguments to the action target function 
Track that new Items were added to the tracked array at index 
Track that count items were removed at index 
Apply all operations reducing them to retain n for n the number of items in the array 
see Sub Array for a better implementation 
Internal data structure to represent an array operation 
Internal data structure used to include information when looking up operations by item index 
Track that an item was added to the tracked array 
Track that an item was removed from the tracked array 
You can directly access mapped properties by simply requesting them The unknown Property handler will generate an Each Array of each item 
primitive for array support 
Clears the set This is useful if you want to reuse an existing set without having to recreate it 
Removes the last element from the set and returns it or null if it s empty 
Use this to find children by ID instead of using j Query 
Adds a class to the buffer which will be rendered to the class attribute 
duck type attribute functionality like j Query so a render buffer can be used like a j Query object in attribute binding scenarios Adds an attribute which will be rendered to the element 
Adds a property which will be rendered to the element 
Generates the HTML content for this buffer 
Sets up event listeners for standard browser events 
Registers an event listener on the document If the given event is triggered the provided event handler will be triggered on the target view 
Invoked by the view system when this view needs to produce an HTML representation This method will create a new render buffer if needed then apply any default attributes such as class names and visibility Finally the render method is invoked which is responsible for doing the bulk of the rendering 
Override the default event firing from Ember Evented to also call methods with the given name 
Return the nearest ancestor that is an instance of the provided class 
Return the nearest ancestor that has a given property 
Return the nearest ancestor whose parent is an instance of klass 
Called on your view when it should push strings of HTML into a Ember Render Buffer Most users will want to override the template or template Name properties instead of this method 
Set up an observer on the context If the property changes toggle the class name 
Iterates through the view s attribute bindings sets up observers for each then applies the current value of the attributes to the passed render buffer 
Gets defined after initialization by apply Attribute Bindings 
Run this callback on the current view unless include Self is false and recursively on child views 
 CORE DISPLAY METHODS Setup a view but do not finish waking it up 
You must call destroy on a view to destroy the view and all of its child views This will remove the view from any parent node then make sure that the DOM element managed by the view can be released by the memory manager 
Instantiates a view to be added to the child Views array during view initialization You generally will not call this method directly unless you are overriding create Child Views Note that this method will automatically configure the correct settings on the new view instance to act as a child of the parent 
Parse a path and return an object which holds the parsed properties 
a view leaves the pre Render state once its element has been created create Element 
when a view is rendered in a buffer appending a child view will render that view and append the resulting buffer into its buffer 
when a view is rendered in a buffer destroying the element will simply destroy the buffer and put the state back into the pre Render state 
once the view has been inserted into the DOM rerendering is deferred to allow bindings to synchronize 
once the view is already in the DOM destroying it removes it from the DOM nukes its element and puts it back into the pre Render state if in DOM 
Handle events from Ember Event Dispatcher 
When a child view is removed destroy its element so that it is removed from the DOM 
When a child view is added make sure the DOM gets updated appropriately 
Called when a mutation to the underlying content array will occur 
Called when a mutation to the underlying content array occurs

Triggers a named action on the controller context where the component is used if this controller has registered for notifications of the action 
Constructor that supports either Metamorph foo or new Metamorph foo Takes a string of HTML as the argument 
 Given a parent node and some HTML generate a set of nodes Return the first node which will allow us to traverse the rest using next Sibling 
 When automatically adding a tbody Internet Explorer inserts the tbody immediately before the first tr Other browsers create it before the first node no matter what 
Renders the unbound form of an otherwise bound helper function 
This is messed up 
Binds a property into the DOM This will create a hook in DOM that the KVO system will look for and update if the property changes 
Transform bindings from the current context to a context that can be evaluated within the view Returns null if the path shouldn t be changed TODO consider the addition of a prefix that would allow this method to return path 
Defeatureify doesn t seem to like nested functions that need to be removed 
NOTE this doesn t really belong here but here it shall remain until our ES transpiler can handle cyclical deps

A hook you can implement to convert the URL into the model for this route 
A hook you can implement to convert the route s model into parameters for the URL 
Returns the controller for a particular route or name 
Disconnects a view that has been rendered into an outlet 
 private 
This is called to setup observers that will trigger a rerender 
Event handler that invokes the link activating the associated route 
Transition the application into another route The route may be either a single route or route path 
Transition into another route while replacing the current URL if possible This will replace the current history entry instead of adding a new one Beside that it is identical to transition To Route in all other respects 
Determines if the view has already been created by checking if the view has the same constructor template and context as the view in the outlets object 
Gets an outlet that is pending disconnection and then nullifys the object on the outlet object 
Returns the current location hash by parsing location href since browsers inconsistently URL decode location hash 
Replaces the current state 
Register a callback to be invoked whenever the browser history changes including using forward and back buttons

This method is called via the container s resolver method It parses the provided full Name and then looks up and returns the appropriate template or class 
Convert the string name of the form type name to a Javascript object with the parsed aspects of the name broken out 
Look up the template in Ember TEMPLATES 
If the application has not opted out of routing and has not explicitly defined a router supply a default router for the application author to configure 
Automatically initialize the application once the DOM has become ready 
Call advance Readiness after any asynchronous setup logic has completed Each call to defer Readiness must be matched by a call to advance Readiness or the application will never become ready and routing will not begin 
Reset the application This is typically used only in tests It cleans up the application in the following order 
Setup up the event dispatcher to receive events on the application s root Element with any registered custom Events 
This creates a container with the default Ember naming conventions 
Fetch the records of a given type and observe them for changes 
Adds observers to a model type class 
Loops over all namespaces and all objects attached to them 
This allows ember testing to play nicely with other asynchronous events such as an application that is waiting for a CSS transition or an Index DB transaction 
unregister Waiter is used to unregister a callback that was registered with register Waiter 
This injects the test helpers into the helper Container object If an object is provided it will be used as the helper Container If helper Container is not set it will default to window If a function of the same name has already been defined it will be cached so that it can be reset if the helper is removed with unregister Helper or remove Test Helpers 
This removes all helpers that have been registered and resets and functions that were overridden by the helpers 
This method is no longer needed But still here for backwards compatibility of helper chaining 
returns the log array 
Adapted from ES section 
Returns a fresh property descriptor that is guaranteed to be complete i e contain all the standard attributes Additionally any non standard enumerable properties of attributes are copied over to the fresh descriptor

Performs all validation that Object define Property performs without actually defining the property Returns a boolean indicating whether validation succeeded 
If get Trap returns undefined the caller should perform the default forwarding behavior If get Trap returns normally otherwise the return value will be a callable trap function When calling the trap function the caller is responsible for binding its this to this handler 
 fundamental traps If name denotes a fixed property check whether target Handler reports it as existent whether the returned descriptor is compatible with the fixed property If the proxy is non extensible check whether name is not a new property Additionally the returned descriptor is normalized and completed 
In the direct proxies design with refactored prototype climbing this trap is deprecated For proxies as prototypes instead of calling this trap the get set has or enumerate traps are called instead 
On success check whether the target object is indeed frozen 
On success check whether the target object is indeed sealed 
On success check whether the target object is indeed non extensible

Checks whether the trap result is consistent with the state of the wrapped target 
Check whether the trap result corresponds to the target s Prototype 
If target is non extensible and set Prototype Of trap returns true check whether the trap result corresponds to the target s Prototype 
 derived traps If name denotes a fixed property check whether the trap returns true If name denotes a new property on a non extensible proxy check whether the trap returns false 
Experimental implementation of the invoke trap on platforms that support no Such Method e g Spidermonkey FF invoke function receiver name args var trap this get Trap invoke if trap undefined default forwarding behavior return Reflect invoke this target name args receiver 
The iterate trap should return an iterator object 
Any own non configurable properties of the target that are not included in the trap result give rise to a Type Error As such we check whether the returned result contains at least all sealed properties of the target object 
In ES this trap is called for all operations that require a list of an object s properties including Object get Own Property Names and Object keys 
New trap that reifies Call If the target is a function then a call to proxy args Triggers this trap 
New trap that reifies Construct If the target is a function then a call to new proxy args Triggers this trap

Given a subclass of DS Model and a JSON object this method will iterate through each attribute of the DS Model and invoke the DS Transform deserialize method on the matching property of the JSON object This method is typically called after the serializer s normalize method 
SERIALIZE Called when a record is saved in order to convert the record into JSON 
serialize Attribute can be used to customize how DS attr properties are serialized 
serialize Belongs To can be used to customize how DS belongs To properties are serialized 
serialize Has Many can be used to customize how DS has Many properties are serialized 
EXTRACT The extract method is used to deserialize payload data from the server By default the JSONSerializer does not push the records into the store However records that subclass JSONSerializer such as the RESTSerializer may push records into the store as part of the extract call 
extract Meta is used to deserialize any meta information in the adapter payload By default Ember Data expects meta information to be located on the meta property of the payload object 
HELPERS 
Saves all of the records in the Record Array 
Overrides Ember Array s replace method to implement 
Create a child record within the owner 
 CREATE NEW RECORD Create a new record in the current store The properties passed to this method are set on the newly created record 
If possible this method asks the adapter to generate an ID for a newly created record 
 FIND RECORDS This is the main entry point into finding records The first parameter to this method is the model s name as a string 
This method returns a record for a given type and id combination 
This method makes a series of requests to the adapter s find method and returns a promise that resolves once they are all loaded 
This method is called by find By Id if it discovers that a particular type id pair hasn t been loaded yet to kick off a request to the adapter 
This method is called by the record s reload method 
This method takes a list of records groups the records by type converts the records into IDs and then invokes the adapter s find Many method 
Returns true if a record for a given type and ID is already loaded 
Returns id record for a given type and ID If one isn t already loaded it builds a new record and leaves it in the empty state 
If a relationship was originally populated by the adapter as a link as opposed to a list of IDs this method is called when the relationship is fetched 
This method delegates a query to the adapter This is the one place where adapter level semantics are exposed to the application 
This method returns a filtered array that contains all of the known records for a given type 
This method unloads all of the known records for a given type 
Takes a type and filter function and returns a live Record Array that remains up to date as new records are loaded into the store or created locally 
This method returns if a certain record is already loaded in the store Use this function to know beforehand if a find will result in a request or that it will be a cache hit 
This method is called at the end of the run loop and flushes any records passed into schedule Save 
This method is called once the promise returned by an adapter s create Record update Record or delete Record is resolved 
When an adapter s create Record update Record or delete Record resolves with data this method extracts the ID from the supplied data 
Returns a map of IDs to client IDs for a given type 
 LOADING DATA This internal method is used by push 
Returns a model class for a particular key Used by methods that take a type key like find create Record etc 
Push some data for a given type into the store 
Push some raw data into the store 
If you have some metadata to set for a type you can call meta For Type 
Build a brand new record for a given type ID and initial data 
 DESTRUCTION When a record is destroyed this un indexes it and removes it from any record arrays so it can be GCed 
 RELATIONSHIP CHANGES 
 PER TYPE ADAPTERS Returns the adapter for a given type 
 RECORD CHANGE NOTIFICATION Returns an instance of the serializer for a given type For example serializer For person will return an instance of App Person Serializer 
If there are any unsaved records that are in a has Many they won t be in the payload so add them back in manually 
 This file encapsulates the various states that a record can transition through during its lifecycle State 
The created and updated states are created outside the state chart so we can reopen their substates and add mixins as necessary 
Adds error messages to a given attribute and sends became Invalid event to the record 
Removes all error messages from the given attribute and sends became Valid event to the record if there no more errors left 
Use DS JSONSerializer DS JSONSerializer html to get the JSON representation of a record 
Returns an object whose keys are changed properties and value is an old Prop new Prop array 
If the adapter did not return a hash in response to a commit merge the changed attributes and relationships into the existing saved data 
If the model is Dirty this function will which discard any unsaved changes 
The goal of this method is to temporarily disable specific observers that take action in response to application changes 
Save the record and persist any changes to the record to an extenal source via the adapter 
Reload the record from the adapter 
FOR USE DURING COMMIT PROCESS 
Override the default event firing from Ember Evented to also call methods with the given name 
Iterates through the attributes of the model calling the passed function on each attribute 
Iterates through the transformed Attributes of the model calling the passed function on each attribute Note the callback will not be called for any attributes that do not have an transformation type 
This Ember js hook allows an object to be notified when a property is defined 
Given a callback iterates over each of the relationships in the model invoking the callback with the name of each relationship and its relationship descriptor 
This method is invoked whenever data is loaded into the store by the adapter or updated by the adapter or when a record has changed 
Update an individual filter 
This method is invoked if the filter Function property is changed on a DS Filtered Record Array

Create a DS Filtered Record Array for a type and register it for updates 
Create a DS Adapter Populated Record Array for a type with given query 
Register a Record Array for a given type to be backed by a filter function This will cause the array to update automatically when records of that type change attribute values or states 
Internally we maintain a map of all unloaded IDs requested by a Many Array As the adapter loads data into the store the store notifies any interested Many Arrays When the Many Array s total number of loading records drops to zero it becomes is Loaded and fires a did Load event

Generic function for counting a line It generates a line Id from the line number and the block name in minified files there are more logical lines on the same file line and adds a function call before the actual line of code 
Walker for if nodes It overrides count Line because we want to instrument conditions 
This is the key function for condition coverage as it wraps every condition in a function call The condition id is generated fron the line Id 
Wheter or not the if decision has only one boolean condition 
Label nodes need special treatment as well 
Instrumenting function strictly needed for statement coverage only in case of defun function definition however the block function does not correspond to a new statement This method allows to track every function call function coverage 
This function tries to extract the name of anonymous functions depending on where they are defined

 setup Called when a Map constructor is defined extended to perform any initialization behavior for the new constructor function 
 setup Initializes the map instance s behavior 
 setup Computes Sets up computed properties on a Map Stores information for each computed property on this computed Attrs that looks like the number of bindings on this property count a handler that forwards events on the compute to the map instance handler handler compute compute the compute 
 attr The primary get set interface for can Map Calls get set or attrs depending on how it is called 
 get Handles reading nested properties like foo bar by getting the value of foo and recursively calling get for the value of bar To read the actual values get calls get 
 get Signals can compute that an observable property is being read 
 get When called with an argument returns the value of this property If that property is represented by a computed attribute return the value of that compute If no argument is provided return the raw data 
 set Handles setting nested properties by finding the nested observable and recursively calling set on it Eventually it calls set with the type converted value to set and the current value The current value is passed for two reasons so set can trigger an event if the value has changed for advanced setting behavior that define set can do If the map is initializing the current value does not need to be read because no change events are dispatched anyway 
 type Converts set values to another type By default this converts Objects to can Maps and Arrays to can Lists This also makes it so if a plain Java Script object has already been converted to a list or map that same list or map instance is used 
 set Handles firing events if the value has changed and works with the bubble helpers to setup bubbling Calls set to do the actual setting 
 set Directly saves the set value as a property on data or sets the computed attribute 
 remove Handles removing nested observes 
 remove Handles triggering an event if a property could be removed 
 serialize Serializes a property Uses map helpers to recursively serialize nested observables 
 set Attrs Sets multiple properties on this object at once First goes through all current properties and either merges or removes old properties Then it goes through the remaining ones to be added and sets those properties 
 trigger Change A helper function used to trigger events on this map If the map is bubbling this will fire a change event Otherwise it only fires a named event Triggers a keys event if a property has been added or removed 
 compute Creates a compute that represents a value on this map If the property is a function on the prototype a function compute wil be created Otherwise a compute will be created that reads the observable attributes

 expects a file Buffer and the JSON describe payload for the m modules array 
 
 so lets take our typical path 
 expects the array of module descriptions back from the solve routine and returns amodule description result complete with file Buffer 
 given what modules are described as being on a photon and target binary info figure out which modules need to be updated on that photon 
 given what modules are described as being on a device and known firmware module info figure out which modules need to be updated on the device 
 given device s describe message figure out if it has missing modules Rejected value contains missing dependencies 
tell us if anything with dependencies is missing something 
 walk over the described modules until we ve resolved our dependency chain for all the dependent things that need updating 
 for modules in location main not for user modules function user 
 the binary prefix contains a numeric value for its dependent module function convert that number into the same characters reported by the photon s u b etc 
 convert the dependency keys from the binary prefix info into the common JSON format used by the describe messages 
 TODO replace with buffer compare once we move to node

this is a quick and dirty logger there are other nicer loggers out there but the ones i found were also somewhat involved this one has a Ruby logger type interface we can easily replace this provide the info debug etc methods are the same or we can change Haiku to use a more standard node js interface 
The Shred object itself constructs the Request object You should rarely need to do this directly 
in milliseconds 
process Options is called from the constructor to handle all the work associated with making sure we do our best to ensure we have a valid request 
create Request is also called by the constructor after process Options This actually makes the request and processes the response so create Request is a bit of a misnomer 
Set up some event magic The precedence is given first to status specific handlers then to responses for a given event and then finally to the more general response handler In the last case we need to first make sure we re not dealing with a a redirect 
Logs the curl command for the request 
Construct a Response object You should never have to do this directly The Request object handles this getting the raw response object and passing it in here along with the request The callback allows us to stream the response and then use the callback to let the request know when it s ready

Service represents a set of grouped values necessary to provide a logical function For instance a Door Lock Mechanism service might contain two values one for the desired lock state and one for the current lock state A particular Service is distinguished from others by its type which is a UUID Home Kit provides a set of known Service UUIDs defined in Home Kit Types js along with a corresponding concrete subclass that you can instantiate directly to setup the necessary values These natively supported Services are expected to contain a particular set of Characteristics 
Characteristic represents a particular typed variable that can be assigned to a Service For instance a Hue Characteristic might store a float value of type arcdegrees You could add the Hue Characteristic to a Service in order to store that value A particular Characteristic is distinguished from others by its UUID Home Kit provides a set of known Characteristic UUIDs defined in Home Kit Types js along with a corresponding concrete subclass

 block Value On stack before hash inverse program value On stack after return value of block Helper Missing The purpose of this opcode is to take a block of the form this foo this foo resolve the value of foo and replace it on the stack with the result of properly invoking block Helper Missing 
 ambiguous Block Value On stack before hash inverse program value Compiler value before last Helper value of last found helper if any On stack after if no last Helper same as block Value On stack after if last Helper value 
 append Content On stack before On stack after Appends the string value of content to the current buffer 
 append On stack before value On stack after Coerces value to a String and appends it to the current buffer If value is truthy or it is coerced into a string and appended Otherwise the empty string is appended 
 lookup On Context On stack before On stack after current Context name Looks up the value of name on the current context and pushes it onto the stack 
 lookup Block Param On stack before On stack after block Param name Looks up the value of parts on the given block param and pushes it onto the stack 
 push String Param On stack before On stack after string current Context This opcode is designed for use in string mode which provides the string value of a parameter along with its depth rather than resolving it immediately 
 register Decorator On stack before hash program params On stack after Pops off the decorator s parameters invokes the decorator and inserts the decorator into the decorators list 
 invoke Helper On stack before hash inverse program params On stack after result of helper invocation Pops off the helper s parameters invokes the helper and pushes the helper s return value onto the stack If the helper is not found helper Missing is called 
 invoke Known Helper On stack before hash inverse program params On stack after result of helper invocation This operation is used when the helper is known to exist so a helper Missing fallback is not required 
 assign To Hash On stack before value hash On stack after hash Pops a value off the stack and assigns it to the current hash
