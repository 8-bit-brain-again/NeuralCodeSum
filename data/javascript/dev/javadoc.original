 CONSTRUCTOR 
Static Tree 
Initialize the tree data structures for a new zlib stream 
Send one empty static block to give enough lookahead for inflate This takes bits of which may remain in the bit buffer The current inflate code requires bits of lookahead If the last two codes for the previous block real code plus EOB were coded on bits or less inflate may have only bits of lookahead to decode the last real code In this case we send two empty static blocks instead of one There are no problems if the previous block is stored or fixed To simplify the code we assume the worst case of last real code encoded on one bit only 
Save the match info and tally the frequency counts Return true if the current block must be flushed 
Send the block data compressed using the given Huffman trees 
Copy a stored block storing first the length and its one s complement if requested 
Send a stored block 
Copy without compression as much as possible from the input stream return the current block state This function does not insert new strings in the dictionary since uncompressible data is probably not useful This function is used only for the level compression option NOTE this function should be optimized to avoid extra copying from window to pending buf 
ZStream 
Read a new buffer from the current input stream update the total number of bytes read All deflate input goes through this function so some applications may wish to modify it to avoid allocating a large strm next in buffer and copying from it See also flush pending

A number with a unit 
less js parser A relatively straight forward predictive parser There is no tokenization lexing stage the input is parsed in one sweep To make the parser fast enough to run in the browser several optimization had to be made Matching and slicing on a huge input is often cause of slowdowns The solution is to chunkify the input into smaller strings The chunks are stored in the chunks var j holds the current chunk index and current Pos holds the index of the current chunk in relation to input This gives us an almost x speed up In many cases we don t need to match individual tokens for example if a value doesn t hold any variables operations or dynamic references the parser can effectively skip it treating it as a literal An example would be px solid which evaluates to itself we don t need to know what the individual components are The drawback of course is that you don t get the benefits of syntax checking on the CSS This gives us a speed up in the parser and a smaller speed up in the code gen Token matching is done with the function which either takes a terminal string or regexp or a non terminal function to call It also takes care of moving all the indices forwards 
Specialization of expect

Parse the input value based on the input type Override this method if you need your own specific parsing 
 Constructs an adjacency graph using the nodes and edges specified through config For each node and edge we add a property dagre that contains an object that will hold intermediate and final layout information Some of the contents include 
 This function is responsible for normalizing the graph The process of normalization ensures that no edge in the graph has spans more than one rank To do this it inserts dummy nodes as needed and links them by adding dummy edges This function keeps enough information in the dummy nodes and edges to ensure that the original graph can be reconstructed later 
 Reconstructs the graph as it was before normalization The positions of dummy nodes are used to build an array of points for the original long edge Dummy nodes and edges are removed 
 For each edge that was reversed during the acyclic step reverse its array of points 
 Given a function a new function is returned that invokes the given function The return value from the function is always the self object 
 Runs the order phase with the specified graph max Sweeps and debug Level If max Sweeps is not specified we use DEFAULT MAX SWEEPS If debug Level is not set we assume 
 Checks if the current ordering of the graph has a lower cross count than the current best If so saves the ordering of the current nodes and the new best cross count This can be used with restore Best to restore the last best ordering 
 Returns the cross count for the given graph 
 Generate an ID that can be used to represent any undirected edge that is incident on u and v 
This function deviates from the standard BK algorithm in two ways First it takes into account the size of the nodes Second it includes a fix to the original algorithm that is described in Carstens Node and Label Placement in a Layered Layout Algorithm 
 Heuristic function that assigns a rank to each node of the input graph with the intent of minimizing edge lengths while respecting the min Len attribute of incident edges 
 This function takes a directed graph that may have cycles and reverses edges as appropriate to break these cycles Each reversed edge is assigned a reversed attribute with the value true 
 Given a graph that has had the acyclic operation applied this function undoes that operation More specifically any edge with the reversed attribute is again reversed to restore the original direction of the edge 
Finds the next edge with the minimum slack 
 This id can be used to group in an undirected manner multi edges incident on the same two nodes 
 A helper to calculate the slack between two nodes u and v given a min Len constraint The slack represents how much the distance between u and v could shrink while maintaining the min Len constraint If the value is negative then the constraint is currently violated 
 Set the cut values of edges in the spanning tree by a depth first postorder traversal The cut value corresponds to the cost in terms of a ranking s edge length sum of lengthening an edge Negative cut values typically indicate edges that would yield a smaller edge length sum if they were lengthened 
Propagate cut values up the tree 
 Perform a DFS postorder traversal labeling each node v with its traversal order lim v and the minimum traversal number of any of its descendants low v This provides an efficient way to test whether u is an ancestor of v since low u lim v lim u if and only if u is an ancestor 
 To compute the cut value of the edge parent child we consider it and any other graph edges to or from the child parent child u v 
 Return whether n is a node in the subtree with the given root 
 Return an edge from the tree with a negative cut value or null if there is none 
 The edge e should be an edge in the tree with an underlying edge in the graph with a negative cut value Of the two nodes incident on the edge take the lower one enter Edge returns an edge with minimum slack going from outside of that node s subtree to inside of that node s subtree 
 Replace edge e with edge f in the tree recalculating the tree root the nodes low and lim properties and the edges cut values 
Redirect edges so that target is the root of its subtree 
 Reset the ranks of all nodes based on the current spanning tree The rank of the tree s root remains unchanged while all other nodes are set to the sum of minimum length constraints along the path from the root 
 If u and v are connected by some edges in the graph return the minimum length of those edges as a positive number if v succeeds u and as a negative number if v precedes u

Constructs a new Set with an optional set of initial Keys 
 Returns an array of all values for properties of o 
This function finds the shortest path from each node to every other reachable node in the graph It is similar to alg dijkstra but instead of returning a single source array it returns a mapping of of source alg dijksta g source weight Func incident Func 
 Given a Digraph g this function returns true if the graph has no cycles and returns false if it does This algorithm returns as soon as it detects the first cycle 
 Given a graph g this function returns an ordered list of nodes such that for each edge u v u appears before v in the list If the graph has a cycle it is impossible to generate such a list and Cycle Exception is thrown

This function associates a component object with a DOM element by calling the components render method assigning an element property on the object and also returning the element It also assigns a virtual Node property based on the return value of the render method This will be used later by perform Element Update to diff the new results of render with the previous results when updating the component s element Finally this function also associates the component with a refs object which is populated with references to elements based on ref properties on nodes of the virtual dom tree Before calling into virtual dom to create the DOM tree it pushes this refs object to a shared stack so it can be accessed by hooks during the creation of individual elements 
This function receives a component that has already been associated with an element via a previous call to initialize and updates this element by calling render on the component When called in normal circumstances it uses the scheduler to defer this update until the next animation frame and will only perform one update of a given component in a given frame This means you can call update repeatedly in a given tick without causing redundant updates If this function called during another synchronous update for example as a result of a call to update on a child component the update is performed synchronously Returns a promise that will resolve when the requested update has been completed 
Synchronsly updates the DOM element associated with a component object This method assumes the presence of element and virtual Node properties on the component which are assigned in the initialize function It calls render on the component to obtain the desired state of the DOM then diff s it with the previous state and patch es the element based on the resulting diff During the patch operation it pushes the component s refs object to a shared stack so that references to DOM elements can be updated If update is called during the invocation of update Sync the requests are processed synchronously as well We track whether this is the case by incrementing and decrementing sync Updates In Progress Counter around the call For now etch does not allow the root tag of the render method to change between invocations because we want to preserve a one to one relationship between component objects and DOM elements for simplicity 
Removes the component s associated element and calls destroy on any child components Normally this function is asynchronous and will perform the destruction on the next animation frame If called as the result of another update or destruction it calls destroy on child components synchronously If called as the result of destroying a component higher in the DOM the element is not removed to avoid redundant DOM manipulation Returns a promise that resolves when the destruction is completed 
A synchronous version of destroy Note that we track whether destroy calls are in progress and only remove the element if we are not a nested call

This function implements the optimized splice implementation that can use special array operations to handle sparse arrays in a sensible fashion 
This function implements the optimized splice implementation that can use special array operations to handle sparse arrays in a sensible fashion 
This is part of the old simple minded splice We are using it either because the receiver is not an array so we have no choice or because we know we are not deleting or moving a lot of elements 
 
Removes the last element from the array and returns it See ECMA section 
Appends the arguments to the end of the array and returns the new length of the array See ECMA section 
For implementing reverse on large sparse arrays 
Copy elements in the range length from obj s prototype chain to obj itself if obj has holes Return one more than the maximal index of a prototype property 
Set a value of undefined on all indices in the range from to where a prototype of obj has an element I e shadow all prototype elements in that range 
The following functions cannot be made efficient on sparse arrays while preserving the semantics since the calls to the receiver function can add or delete elements from the array 
Executes the function once for each element present in the array until it finds one where callback returns true 
For index Of we don t need to pass in the number of arguments at the callsite since To Integer undefined however for last Index Of we need to pass it since the behavior for passing undefined is but for not including the argument is length

There are cases where a suitable ancestor in the tree cannot be found or a few docs are missing due to race conditions To mop these up we make a penultimate pass that considers every unique workflow Guid preferring the locale with the most docs as a basis but falling back if necessary to any in which it exists And in the final pass we use an aggregation query to find absolutely every last workflow Guid that does not have every locale 
Due to join projections we often do not know the guids of the related docs yet and even sometimes the type as well 
Resolve relationship ids in the from document which will have been in a draft locale and in the draft document where we are exporting to to point to a consistent locale so that the diff applies properly 
First pass for some workflow Guids only some of the locales have a parked Id due to various catch s Give them all a parked Id

 Array module 
 method some f scope returns Boolean short Returns true if any element in the array matches f extra scope is the this object any is provided as an alias In addition to providing this method for browsers that don t support it natively this method also implements array matching example 
 method map map scope returns Array short Maps the array to another array containing the values that are the result of calling map on each element extra scope is the this object In addition to providing this method for browsers that don t support it natively this enhanced method also directly accepts a string which is a shortcut for a function that gets that property or invokes a function on each element example 
 method for Each fn scope returns Nothing short Iterates over the array calling fn on each loop extra This method is only provided for those browsers that do not support it natively scope becomes the this object example 
 String module 
 method bind scope arg returns Function short Binds scope as the this object for the function when it is called Also allows currying an unlimited number of parameters extra currying means setting parameters arg arg etc ahead of time so that they are passed when the function is called later If you pass additional parameters when the function is actually called they will be added will be added to the end of the curried parameters This method is provided for browsers that don t support it internally example

 method find All f index loop false returns Array short Returns all elements that match f extra f will match a string number array object or alternately test against a function or regex Starts at index and will continue once from index if loop is true This method implements array matching example 
 method find Index f start Index loop false returns Number short Returns the index of the first element that matches f or if not found extra This method has a few notable differences to native index Of Although f will similarly match a primitive such as a string or number it will also match deep objects and arrays that are not equal by reference Additionally if a function is passed it will be run as a matching function similar to the behavior of Array filter rather than attempting to find that function itself by reference in the array Starts at index and will continue once from index if loop is true This method implements array matching example 
 method remove At start end returns Array short Removes element at start If end is specified removes the range between start and end This method will change the array If you don t intend the array to be changed use clone first example 
 method last num returns Mixed short Returns the last element s in the array extra When num is passed returns the last num elements in the array example 
 method sum map returns Number short Sums all values in the array extra map may be a function mapping the value to be summed or a string acting as a shortcut example 
 method average map returns Number short Averages all values in the array extra map may be a function mapping the value to be averaged or a string acting as a shortcut example 
 method in Groups num padding returns Array short Groups the array into num arrays extra padding specifies a value with which to pad the last array so that they are all equal length example 
 method sort By map desc false returns Array short Sorts the array by map extra map may be a function a string acting as a shortcut or blank direct comparison of array values desc will sort the array in descending order When the field being sorted on is a string the resulting order will be determined by an internal collation algorithm that is optimized for major Western languages but can be customized For more information see array sorting example 
 method randomize returns Array short Returns a copy of the array with the elements randomized extra Uses Fisher Yates algorithm example 
 method zip arr arr returns Array short Merges multiple arrays together extra This method zips up smaller arrays into one large whose elements are all elements at index all elements at index etc Useful when you have associated data that is split over separated arrays If the arrays passed have more elements than the original array they will be discarded If they have fewer elements the missing elements will filled with null example 
 method add el index returns Array short Adds el to the array extra If index is specified it will add at index otherwise adds to the end of the array add behaves like concat in that if el is an array it will be joined not inserted This method will change the array Use include for a non destructive alias Also insert is provided as an alias that reads better when using an index example 
 method remove f f returns Array short Removes any element in the array that matches f f etc extra Will match a string number array object or alternately test against a function or regex This method will change the array Use exclude for a non destructive alias This method implements array matching example 
 method compact all false returns Array short Removes all instances of undefined null and Na N from the array extra If all is true all falsy elements will be removed This includes empty strings and false example

The ISO format allows times strung together without a demarcating so make sure that these markers are now optional 
If the month is being set then we don t want to accidentally traverse into a new month just because the target month doesn t have enough days In other words months ago from July th is still February even though there is no February th so it will of necessity be February th or th in the case of a leap year 
 method units Since d locale current Locale returns Number short Returns the time since d in the appropriate unit extra d will accept a date object timestamp or text format If not specified d is assumed to be now locale can be passed to specify the locale that the date is in unit Ago is provided as an alias to make this more readable when d is assumed to be the current date For more see date format 
since until now only count past an integer i e days ago is anything between days The default margin of error is but months have an inherently larger margin as the number of days in a given month may be significantly less than the number of days in the average month so for example days before March may in fact be month ago Years also have a margin of error due to leap years but this is roughly anyway Other units do not technically need the error margin applied to them but this accounts for discrepancies like hours Ago which technically creates the current date first then creates a date hours before and compares them the discrepancy between the creation of the dates means that they may actually be hours apart Milliseconds don t have fractions so they won t be subject to this error margin 
 method is Day returns Boolean short Returns true if the date falls on that day extra Also available is Yesterday is Today is Tomorrow is Weekday and is Weekend 
 method Date set Locale code returns Locale short Sets the current locale to be used with dates extra Sugar has support for locales that are available through the Date Locales package In addition you can define a new locale with Date add Locale For more see date format 
 method set ISOWeek returns Nothing short Sets the week of the year as defined by the ISO standard extra Note that this standard places Sunday at the end of the week day 
 method get UTCOffset iso returns String short Returns a string representation of the offset from UTC time If iso is true the offset will be in ISO format example 
 method relative fn locale current Locale returns String short Returns a relative date string offset to the current time extra fn can be passed to provide for more granular control over the resulting string fn is passed arguments the adjusted value unit offset in milliseconds and a localization object As an alternate syntax locale can also be passed as the first and only parameter For more see date format example 
 method is d margin returns Boolean short Returns true if the date is d extra d will accept a date object timestamp or text format is additionally understands more generalized expressions like month weekday names today etc and compares to the precision implied in d margin allows an extra margin of error in milliseconds For more see date format example 
 method reset unit hours returns Date short Resets the unit passed and all smaller units Default is hours effectively resetting the time example 
 Number module 
 package Date Range dependency date description Date Ranges define a range of time They can enumerate over specific points within that range and be manipulated and compared 
 method contains d returns Boolean short Returns true if d is contained inside the Date Range d may be a date or another Date Range example 
 method every increment fn returns Array short Iterates through the Date Range for every increment calling fn if it is passed Returns an array of each increment visited extra When increment is a number increments will be to the exact millisecond increment can also be a string in the format number unit s in which case it will increment in the unit specified Note that a discrepancy exists in the case of months as months is an approximation Stepping through the actual months by passing months is usually preferable in this case example 
 method union range returns Date Range short Returns a new Date Range with the earliest starting point as its start and the latest ending point as its end If the two ranges do not intersect this will effectively remove the gap between them example 
 package Function dependency core description Lazy throttled and memoized functions delayed functions and handling of timers argument currying 
 method lazy ms limit Infinity returns Function short Creates a lazy function that when called repeatedly will queue execution and wait ms milliseconds to execute again extra Lazy functions will always execute as many times as they are called up to limit after which point subsequent calls will be ignored if it is set to a finite number Compare this to throttle which will execute only once per ms milliseconds lazy is useful when you need to be sure that every call to a function is executed but in a non blocking manner Calling cancel on a lazy function will clear the entire queue Note that ms can also be a fraction example 
 method delay ms arg returns Function short Executes the function after ms milliseconds extra Returns a reference to itself delay is also a way to execute non blocking operations that will wait until the CPU is free Delayed functions can be canceled using the cancel method Can also curry arguments passed in after ms example 
 method debounce ms returns Function short Creates a debounced function that postpones its execution until after ms milliseconds have passed extra This method is useful to execute a function after things have settled down A good example of this is when a user tabs quickly through form fields execution of a heavy operation should happen after a few milliseconds when they have settled on a field example 
 method after num returns Function short Creates a function that will execute after num calls extra after is useful for running a final callback after a series of asynchronous operations when the order in which the operations will complete is unknown example 
 method fill arg arg returns Function short Returns a new version of the function which when called will have some of its arguments pre emptively filled in also known as currying extra Arguments passed to a filled function are generally appended to the curried arguments However if undefined is passed as any of the arguments to fill it will be replaced when the filled function is executed This allows currying of arguments even when they occur toward the end of an argument list the example demonstrates this much more clearly example 
 package Number dependency core description Number formatting rounding with precision and ranges Aliases to Math methods 
 method Number random n n returns Number short Returns a random integer between n and n extra If only number is passed the other will be If none are passed the number will be either or example

 method Object is Type obj returns Boolean short Returns true if obj is an object of that type extra is Object will return false on anything that is not an object literal including instances of inherited classes Note also that is Na N will ONLY return true if the object IS Na N It does not mean the same as browser native is Na N which returns true for anything that is not a number 
 method watch obj prop fn returns Nothing short Watches a property of obj and runs fn when it changes extra fn is passed three arguments the property prop the old value and the new value The return value of fn will be set as the new value This method is useful for things such as validating or cleaning the value when it is set Warning this method WILL NOT work in browsers that don t support Object define Property This notably includes IE and below and Opera This is the only method in Sugar that is not fully compatible with all browsers watch is available as an instance method on extended objects example 
 method keys obj fn returns Array short Returns an array containing the keys in obj Optionally calls fn for each key extra This method is provided for browsers that don t support it natively and additionally is enhanced to accept the callback fn Returned keys are in no particular order keys is available as an instance method on extended objects example 
 method merge target source deep false resolve true returns Merged object short Merges all the properties of source into target extra Merges are shallow unless deep is true Properties of source will win in the case of conflicts unless resolve is false resolve can also be a function that resolves the conflict In this case it will be passed arguments key target Val and source Val with the context set to source This will allow you to solve conflict any way you want ie adding two numbers together etc merge is available as an instance method on extended objects example 
 method values obj fn returns Array short Returns an array containing the values in obj Optionally calls fn for each value extra Returned values are in no particular order values is available as an instance method on extended objects example

We have some updates that are applied to the backed since last sync run However those updates are not in the local Dataset Client yet they will in after next sync run But those updates are applied on the client already This means when we compute the delta between the client records and the local Dataset Client those changes will be reverted from the client To avoid that we loop through those updates and remove them both from the client Records and local Dataset Client This way there will be no delta for those records and the client will keep there records 
We have some pending changes sent in by the client and waiting in the queue They are not processed yet so the backend or our local Dataset don t have those changes We don t know if those changes will be applied or not But they are already applied on the client which means if we compute the delta as it is those changes will be reverted To avoid that we will remove those changes from both the client and the local Dataset so that the client will keep them for now

Array handling Arrays are special because unlike other property types they have standard mutator functions push pop splice etc and it s desirable to trigger a change notification whenever one of those mutator functions is invoked Traditionally Knockout handles this by putting special versions of push pop etc on observable arrays that mutate the underlying array and then trigger a notification That approach doesn t work for Knockout ES because properties now return the underlying arrays so the mutator runs in the context of the underlying array not any particular observable Operates on the underlying array value my Model some Collection push New value To solve this Knockout ES detects array values and modifies them as follows Associates a hidden subscribable with each array instance that it encounters Intercepts standard mutators push pop etc and makes them trigger the subscribable Then for model properties whose values are arrays the property s underlying observable subscribes to the array subscribable so it can trigger a change notification after mutation After each array mutation fires a notification on the given subscribable 
Adds Knockout s additional array mutation functions to the array 
Gets or creates a subscribable that fires after each array mutation 
Listens for array mutations and when they happen cause the observable to fire notifications This is used to make model properties of type array fire notifications when the array changes Returns a subscribable that can later be disposed 
Given an observable that underlies a model property watch for any array value that might be assigned as the property value and hook into its change events

bind the proxy events to the current app 
unbind the proxy events from the current app 
use is the entry point for including Sammy plugins The first argument to use should be a function that is evaluated in the context of the current application just like the app function argument to the Sammy Application constructor Any additional arguments are passed to the app function sequentially For much more detail about plugins check out http code quirkey com sammy doc plugins html Example var My Plugin function app prepend this helpers myhelper function text alert prepend text var app sammy function this use My Plugin This is my plugin this get function this myhelper and dont you forget it Alerts This is my plugin and dont you forget it If plugin is passed as a string it assumes your are trying to load Sammy Plugin This is the prefered way of loading core Sammy plugins as it allows for better error messaging Example sammy function this use Mustache Sammy Mustache this use Storage Sammy Storage 
Sets the location proxy for the current app By default this is set to a new Sammy Hash Location Proxy on initialization However you can set the location proxy inside you re app function to give your app a custom location mechanism See Sammy Hash Location Proxy and Sammy Data Location Proxy for examples set Location Proxy takes an initialized location proxy Example to bind to data instead of the default hash var app sammy function this set Location Proxy new Sammy Data Location Proxy this 
route is the main method for defining routes within an application For great detail on routes check out http code quirkey com sammy doc routes html This method also has aliases for each of the different verbs eg get post etc Arguments verb A String in the set of ROUTE VERBS or any any will add routes for each of the ROUTE VERBS If only two arguments are passed the first argument is the path the second is the callback and the verb is assumed to be any path A Regexp or a String representing the path to match to invoke this verb callback A Function that is called evaluated whent the route is run see run Route It is also possible to pass a string as the callback which is looked up as the name of a method on the application 
map Routes takes an array of arrays each array being passed to route as arguments this allows for mass definition of routes Another benefit is this makes it possible easier to load routes via remote JSON Example var app sammy function this map Routes get function this log index strings in callbacks are looked up as methods on the app post create add User No verb assumes any as the verb dowhatever function this log this verb this path 
Works just like j Query fn bind with a couple noteable differences It binds all events to the application element All events are bound within the event Namespace Events are not actually bound until the application is started with run callbacks are evaluated within the context of a Sammy Event Context See http code quirkey com sammy docs events html for more info 
Takes a single callback that is pushed on to a stack Before any route is run the callbacks are evaluated in order within the current Sammy Event Context If any of the callbacks explicitly return false execution of any further callbacks and the route itself is halted You can also provide a set of options that will define when to run this before based on the route it proceeds Example var app sammy function will run at route but not at this before route function will run at but not at route this before except path route function this log not before route this get function this get route function See context Matches Options for a full list of supported options 
Actually starts the application s lifecycle run should be invoked within a document ready block to ensure the DOM exists before binding events etc Example var app sammy function your application function document ready app run Arguments start url Optionally a String can be passed which the App will redirect to after the events routes have been bound 
The opposite of run un binds all event listeners and intervals run Automaticaly binds a onunload event to run this when the document is closed 
Will bind a single callback function to every event that is already being listened to in the app This includes all the APP EVENTS as well as any custom events defined with bind Used internally for debug logging 
Given a verb and a String path will return either a route object or false if a matching route can be found within the current defined set 
First invokes lookup Route and if a route is found parses the possible URL params and then invokes the route s callback within a new Sammy Event Context If the route can not be found it calls not Found If raise errors is set to true and the error has not been overriden it will throw an actual JS error You probably will never have to call this directly Arguments verb A String for the verb path A String path to lookup params An Object of Params pulled from the URI or passed directly Returns Either returns the value returned by the route callback or raises a Not Found error 
Matches an object of options against an Event Context like object that contains path and verb attributes Internally Sammy uses this for matching before filters against specific options You can set the object to only match certain paths or verbs or match all paths or verbs except those that match the options Example var app sammy context verb get path mypath match against a path string app context Matches Options context mypath true app context Matches Options context otherpath false equivilent to app context Matches Options context only path mypath true app context Matches Options context only path otherpath false match against a path regexp app context Matches Options context path true app context Matches Options context path false match only a verb app context Matches Options context only verb get true app context Matches Options context only verb post false match all except a verb app context Matches Options context except verb post true app context Matches Options context except verb get false match all except a path app context Matches Options context except path otherpath true app context Matches Options context except path mypath false 
This thows a Not Found error by invoking error Override this method or error to provide custom behavior i e redirecting to or showing a warning 
The base error handler takes a string message and an Error object If raise errors is set to true on the app level this will re throw the error to the browser Otherwise it will send the error to log Override this method to provide custom error handling e g logging to a server side component or displaying some feedback to the user 
The core of the Render Context object adds the callback to the queue If the context is waiting meaning an async operation is happening then the callback will be executed in order once the other operations are complete If there is no currently executing operation the callback is executed immediately The value returned from the callback is stored in content for the subsiquent operation If you return false the queue will pause and the next callback in the queue will not be executed until next is called This allows for the guarunteed order of execution while working with async operations If then is passed a string instead of a function the string is looked up as a helper method on the event context Example this get function initialize the Render Context Even though load executes async the next then wont execute until the load finishes this load myfile txt then function content the first argument to then is the content of the prev operation main html content 
Resume the queue setting content to be used in the next operation See wait for an example 
Load a template into the context The location can either be a string specifiying the remote path to the file a j Query object or a DOM element No interpolation happens by default the content is stored in content In the case of a path unless the option cache false is passed the data is stored in the app s template Cache If a j Query or DOM object is passed the inner HTML of the node is pulled in This is useful for nesting templates as part of the initial page load wrapped in invisible elements or script tags With template paths the template engine is looked up by the extension For DOM j Query embedded templates this isnt possible so there are a couple of options pass an engine option define the engine in the data engine attribute of the passed node just store the raw template data and use interpolate manually If a callback is passed it is executed after the template load 
load a template and then interpolate it with data Example this get function this render mytemplate template name test 
defers the call of function to occur in order of the render queue The function can accept any number of arguments as long as the last argument is a callback function This is useful for putting arbitrary asynchronous functions into the queue The content passed to the callback is passed as content to the next item in the queue Example this send get JSON app json then function json message text json message 
itterates over an array applying the callback for each item item the callback takes the same style of arguments as j Query each index item The return value of each callback is collected as a single string and stored as content to be used in the next iteration of the Render Context 
loads a template and then interpolates it for each item in the data array If a callback is passed it will call the callback with each item in the array after interpolation 
trigger the event in the order of the event context Same semantics as Sammy Event Context trigger If data is ommitted content is sent as content content 
Look up a templating engine within the current app and context engine can be one of the following a function should conform to function content data return interploated a template path template ejs looks up the extension to match to the ejs helper a string referering to the helper mustache mustache If no engine is found use the app s default template engine 
Create and return a Sammy Render Context calling render Each on it Loads the template and interpolates the data for each item however does not actual place it in the DOM Example mytemplate mustache div class name name div render Each mytemplate mustache name quirkey name endor sets the content to div class name quirkey div div class name endor div render Each mytemplate mustache name quirkey name endor append To ul appends the rendered content to ul 
Changes the location of the current window If to begins with it only changes the document s hash If passed more than argument redirect will join them together with forward slashes Example redirect other route equivilent to redirect other route

Locate the first occurrence of Unicode null terminator i e a sequence of two zeroed out octets in Data View view Search starts at given offset and ends after length octets Will return the absolute offset of sequence if found otherwise 
Parse Data View view begining at offset index and return a string built from length octets The view is parsed as an array of bit single byte coded characters i e ISO IEC non Unicode Will essentially return the string comprised of octets offset offset length Note that no check is performed for the adequate length of given view as this should be carried out be the caller as part of the section parsing process 
UCS ISO IEC UCS version of read Str UCS is the fixed width two byte subset of Unicode that can only express values inside the Basic Multilingual Plane BMP Note that this method is generally unsuitable for parsing non trivial UTF strings which may contain surrogate pairs This is only marginally related though as according to ID v all Unicode strings should be UCS Further info How to convert Array Buffer to and from String http updates html rocks com How to convert Array Buffer to and from String The encoding spec http encoding spec whatwg org stringencoding shim https code google com p stringencoding About the BOM The current implementation will check for and remove the leading BOM from the given view to avoid invisible characters that mess up the resulting strings MDN s documentation for from Char Code https developer mozilla org en docs Web Java Script Reference Global Objects String from Char Code suggests that it can correctly convert UCS buffers to strings And indeed tests performed with UCS LE encoded frames indicate that it does However no tests have been made for UCS BE Kid the ID v Tag generator used for tests at the time of this writing goes totally weird when switched to BE

The information required to tell the user there is a problem with their input TODO There a several places where start end crop up Perhaps we should have a Cursor object 
A Hint that arose as a result of a Conversion 
We record where in the input string an argument comes so we can report errors against those string positions We publish a change event when ever the text changes 
Return the result of merging these arguments TODO What happens when we re merging arguments for the single string case and some of the arguments are in quotation marks 
See notes on events in Assignment We might need to hook changes here into a Cli Requisition so they appear of the command line 
A link between a parameter and the data for that parameter The data for the parameter is available as in the preferred type and as an Argument for the CLI p We also record validity information where applicable p For values null and undefined have distinct definitions null means that a value has been provided undefined means that it has not Thus null is a valid default value and common because it identifies an parameter that is optional undefined means there is no value from the command line 
Create a list of the hints associated with this parameter assignment Generally there will be only one hint generated because we re currently only displaying one hint at a time ordering by distance from cursor and severity Since distance from cursor will be the same for all hints from this assignment all but the most severe will ever be used It might make sense with more experience to alter this to function to be get Hint 
If the cursor is at position do we have sufficient data to start displaying the next hint This is both complex and important For example if the user has just typed ul li set tabstop then they clearly want to know about the valid values for the tabstop setting so the hint is based on the next parameter li set tabstop without trailing space they will probably still want to know about the valid values for the tabstop setting because there is no confusion about the setting in question li set tabsto they ve not finished typing a setting name so the hint should be based on the current parameter li set tabstop when there is an additional tabstopstyle setting we can t make assumptions about the setting we re not finished ul p Note that the input for and is identical only the configuration has changed so hint display is environmental 
Provide some documentation for a command 
When the command changes we need to keep a bunch of stuff in sync

Parse a string into a mapping of logger names to levels to determine which level of logging a given logging module should use This is done so that we can optionally have Trace level for what you re working on but then only have warnings and higher for the rest of the code This is similar in concept to the debug module but needs higher granularity because we have more than one log level There is currently no globbing support so you will have to specify all name values in the variable as fully resolved The special value as a name sets the log level for all levels not mentioned 
Create a root logger with the name given by name The object returned from this function is a root logger The design is that each service component or library will use a single root logger object that s initialised a single time 
In order to ease the transition from using the debug module for logging to using this library we have a function that allows the root logger to expose an api similar to the debug module The first returned function takes a name to use as the debug name and returns a function which accepts log messages The log messages can use util format formatting to produce desired output
