Image Locality Priority Map is a priority function that favors nodes that already have requested pod container s images It will detect whether the requested images are present on a node and then calculate a score ranging from to based on the total size of those images If none of the images are present this node will be given the lowest priority If some of the images are present on a node the larger their sizes sum the higher the node s priority 
calculate Priority returns the priority of a node Given the sum Scores of requested images on the node the node s priority is obtained by scaling the maximum priority value with a ratio proportional to the sum Scores 
sum Image Scores returns the sum of image scores of all the containers that are already on the node Each image receives a raw score of its size scaled by scaled Image Score The raw scores are later used to calculate the final score Note that the init containers are not considered for it s rare for users to deploy huge init containers 
scaled Image Score returns an adaptively scaled score for the given state of an image The size of the image is used as the base score scaled by a factor which considers how much nodes the image has spread to This heuristic aims to mitigate the undesirable node heating problem i e pods get assigned to the same or a few nodes due to image locality

New Defaulting Codec For Scheme is a convenience method for callers that are using a scheme 
New Codec takes objects in their internal versions and converts them to external versions before serializing them It assumes the serializer provided to it only deals with external versions This class is also a serializer but is generally used with a specific version 
Decode attempts a decode of the object then tries to convert it to the internal version If into is provided and the decoding is successful the returned runtime Object will be the value passed as into Note that this may bypass conversion if you pass an into that matches the serialized version 
Encode ensures the provided object is output in the appropriate group and version invoking conversion if necessary Unversioned objects according to the Object Typer are output as is

Can Use IPTables Proxier returns true if we should use the iptables Proxier instead of the classic userspace Proxier This is determined by checking the iptables version and for the existence of kernel features It may return an error if it fails to get the iptables version without error in which case it will also return false 
returns a new proxy Service Port which abstracts a service Info 
Equal overrides the Equal function implemented by proxy Base Endpoint Info 
Returns the endpoint chain name for a given endpoints Info 
New Proxier returns a new Proxier given an iptables Interface instance Because of the iptables logic it is assumed that there is only a single Proxier active on a machine An error will be returned if iptables fails to update or acquire the initial lock Once a proxier is created it will keep iptables up to date in the background and will not terminate if a particular iptables call fails 
Cleanup Leftovers removes all iptables rules and chains created by the Proxier It returns true if an error was encountered Errors are logged 
This assumes proxier mu is held 
This assumes proxier mu is held 
port Proto Hash takes the Service Port Name and protocol for a service returns the associated character hash This is computed by hashing sha then encoding to base and truncating to chars We do this because IPTables Chain Names must be chars long and the longer they are the harder they are to read

service Firewall Chain Name takes the Service Port Name for a service and returns the associated iptables chain This is computed by hashing sha then encoding to base and truncating with the prefix KUBE FW 
service LBPort Chain Name takes the Service Port Name for a service and returns the associated iptables chain This is computed by hashing sha then encoding to base and truncating with the prefix KUBE XLB We do this because IPTables Chain Names must be chars long and the longer they are the harder they are to read 
This is the same as service Port Chain Name but with the endpoint included 
After a UDP endpoint has been removed we must flush any pending conntrack entries to it or else we risk sending more traffic to it all of which will be lost because UDP This assumes the proxier mutex is held TODO move it to util 
Assumes proxier mu is held 
This is where all of the iptables save restore calls happen The only other iptables rules are those that are setup in iptables Init This assumes proxier mu is NOT held

Load Client Config tries to load the appropriate client config for retrieving certs and for use by users If bootstrap Path is empty only kubeconfig Path is checked If bootstrap path is set and the contents of kubeconfig Path are valid both cert Config and user Config will point to that file Otherwise the kubeconfig Path on disk is populated based on bootstrap Path but pointing to the location of the client cert in cert Dir This preserves the historical behavior of bootstrapping where on subsequent restarts the most recent client cert is used to request new client certs instead of the initial token 
Load Client Cert requests a client cert for kubelet if the kubeconfig Path file does not exist The kubeconfig at bootstrap Path is used to request a client certificate from the API server On success a kubeconfig file referencing the generated key and obtained certificate is written to kubeconfig Path The certificate and key file are stored in cert Dir

Until Without Retry reads items from the watch until each provided condition succeeds and then returns the last watch encountered The first condition that returns an error terminates the watch and the event is also returned If no event has been received the returned event will be nil Conditions are satisfied sequentially so as to provide a useful primitive for higher level composition Waits until context deadline or until context is canceled Warning Unless you have a very specific use case probably a special Watcher don t use this function Warning This will fail e g on API timeouts and or too old resource version error Warning You are most probably looking for a function Until or Until With Sync below Warning solving such issues TODO Consider making this function private to prevent misuse when the other occurrences in our codebase are gone 
Until wraps the watcher Client s watch function with Retry Watcher making sure that watcher gets restarted in case of errors The initial Resource Version will be given to watch method when first called It shall not be or given the underlying WATCH call issues If you want the initial list done for you use List Watch Until instead Remaining behaviour is identical to function Until Without Retry See above Until can deal with API timeouts and lost connections It guarantees you to see all events and in the order they happened Due to this guarantee there is no way it can deal with Resource version too old error It will fail in this case See Until With Sync if you d prefer to recover from all the errors including RV too old by re listing those items In normal code you should care about being level driven so you d not care about not seeing all the edges The most frequent usage for Until would be a test where you want to verify exact order of events edges 
Until With Sync creates an informer from lw optionally checks precondition when the store is synced and watches the output until each provided condition succeeds in a way that is identical to function Until Without Retry See above Until With Sync can deal with all errors like API timeout lost connections and Resource version too old It is the only function that can recover from Resource version too old Until and Until Without Retry will just fail in that case On the other hand it can t provide you with guarantees as strong as using simple Watch method with Until It can skip some intermediate events in case of watch function failing but it will re list to recover and you always get an event if there has been a change after recovery Also with the current implementation based on Delta FIFO order of the events you receive is guaranteed only for particular object not between more of them even it s the same resource The most frequent usage would be a command that needs to watch the state of the world and should t fail like waiting for object reaching a state small controllers 
Context With Optional Timeout wraps context With Timeout and handles infinite timeouts expressed as duration 
List Watch Until first lists objects converts them into synthetic ADDED events and checks conditions for those synthetic events If the conditions have not been reached so far it continues by calling Until which establishes a watch from resource Version of the list call to evaluate those conditions based on new events List Watch Until provides the same guarantees as Until and replaces the old WATCH from RV or which was mixing list and watch calls internally and having severe design issues see There is no resource Version order guarantee for the initial list and those synthetic events

Resource Limits Priority Map is a priority function that increases score of input node by if the node satisfies input pod s resource limits In detail this priority function works as follows If a node does not publish its allocatable resources cpu and memory both the node score is not affected If a pod does not specify its cpu and memory limits both the node score is not affected If one or both of cpu and memory limits of the pod are satisfied the node is assigned a score of Rationale of choosing the lowest score of is that this is mainly selected to break ties between nodes that have same scores assigned by one of least and most requested priority functions 
get Resource Limits computes resource limits for input pod The reason to create this new function is to be consistent with other priority functions because most or perhaps all priority functions work with schedulernodeinfo Resource TODO cache it as part of metadata passed to priority functions

Object Reflect Diff returns a multi line formatted diff between two objects of equal type If an object with private fields is passed you will only see string comparison for those fields Otherwise this presents the most human friendly diff of two structs of equal type in this package 
limit stringifies a Obj and b Obj elides identical prefixes if either is too long elides remaining content from the end if either is too long 
Object Go Print Side By Side prints a and b as textual dumps side by side enabling easy visual scanning for mismatches

check Field returns true if the field name matches any of the struct field copying rules The error should be ignored if it returns false 
New Integer Resource Version Mutation Cache returns a Mutation Cache that understands how to deal with objects that have a resource version that is an integer increases when updated is comparable across the same resource in a namespace Most backends will have these semantics Indexer may be nil ttl controls how long an item remains in the mutation cache before it is removed If include Adds is true objects in the mutation cache will be returned even if they don t exist in the underlying store This is only safe if your use of the cache can handle mutation entries remaining in the cache for up to ttl when mutations and deletes occur very closely in time 
Get By Key is never guaranteed to return back the value set in Mutation It could be paged out it could be older than another copy the backing Cache may be more recent or you might have written twice into the same key You get a value that was valid at some snapshot of time and will always return the newer of backing Cache and mutation Cache 
By Index returns the newer objects that match the provided index and indexer key Will return an error if no indexer was provided 
newer Object checks the mutation cache for a newer object and returns one if found If the mutated object is older than the backing object it is removed from the Must be called while the lock is held 
Mutation adds a change to the cache that can be returned in Get By Key if it is newer than the backing Cache copy If you call Mutation twice with the same object on different threads one will win but its not defined which one This doesn t affect correctness since the Get By Key guaranteed of later of these two caches is preserved but you may not get the version of the object you want The object you get is only guaranteed to one that was valid at some point in time not the one that I want

Versioned Params will take the provided object serialize it to a map string string using the implicit RESTClient API version and the default parameter codec and then add those as parameters to the request Use this to provide versioned query parameters from client libraries Versioned Params will not write query parameters that have omitempty set and are empty If a parameter has already been set it is appended to Params and Versioned Params are additive 
Timeout makes the request use the given duration as an overall timeout for the request Additionally if set passes the value as timeout parameter in URL 
Body makes the request use obj as the body Optional If obj is a string try to read a file of that name If obj is a byte send it directly If obj is an io Reader use it directly If obj is a runtime Object marshal it correctly and set Content Type header If obj is a runtime Object and nil do nothing Otherwise set an error 
Context adds a context to the request Contexts are only used for timeouts deadlines and cancellations 
final URLTemplate is similar to URL but will make all specific parameter values equal instead of name or namespace name and namespace will be used and all query parameters will be reset This creates a copy of the url so as not to change the underlying object

Do Raw executes the request but does not process the response body 
transform Response converts an API response into a structured API object 
truncate Body decides if the body should be truncated based on the glog Verbosity 
glog Body logs a body output that could be either JSON or protobuf It explicitly guards against allocating a new string for the body output unless necessary Uses a simple heuristic to determine whether the body is printable 
transform Unstructured Response Error handles an error from the server that is not in a structured form It is expected to transform any response that is not recognizable as a clear server sent error from the K S API using the information provided with the request In practice HTTP proxies and client libraries introduce a level of uncertainty to the responses returned by servers that in common use result in unexpected responses The rough structure is Assume the server sends you something sane JSON well defined error objects proper codes this is the happy path when you get this output trust what the server sends Guard against empty fields bodies in received JSON and attempt to cull sufficient info from them to generate a reasonable facsimile of the original failure Be sure to use a distinct error type or flag that allows a client to distinguish between this and error above Handle true disconnect failures completely malformed data by moving up to a more generic client error Distinguish between various connection failures like SSL certificates timeouts proxy errors unexpected initial contact the presence of mismatched body contents from posted content types Give these a separate distinct error type and capture as much as possible of the original message TODO introduce transformation of generic http Client Do errors that separates 
new Unstructured Response Error instantiates the appropriate generic error for the provided input It also logs the body 
is Text Response returns true if the response appears to be a textual media type 
Get returns the result as an object which means it passes through the decoder If the returned object is of type Status and has Status Status Success the additional information in Status will be used to enrich the error 
Status Code returns the HTTP status code of the request Only valid if no error was returned 
Into stores the result into obj if possible If obj is nil it is ignored If the returned object is of type Status and has Status Status Success the additional information in Status will be used to enrich the error 
Was Created updates the provided bool pointer to whether the server returned created or a different response 
Error returns the error executing the request nil if no error occurred If the returned object is of type Status and has Status Status Success the additional information in Status will be used to enrich the error See the Request Do comment for what errors you might get
